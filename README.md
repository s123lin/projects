# GitHub Projects Homepage
Hey, thanks for stopping by. This is my personal GitHub repository where I store my miscellaneous projects. Most of the projects are personal projects I'm working on. I don't have a specific topic or field that I focus my work in. I mostly work on whatever interests me or whenever I feel inspired. Since I'm currently focusing on my graduate studies, I usually work on these during my free time.

## Current Projects in Repository
- Big Data Case Study â€“ Tensorflow and Neural Networks for Face Recognition
- Travis County Real Estate Search

## Future Projects
- Normalization of musical melodies for song recognition
- Organic chemistry reaction detection
